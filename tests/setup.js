 * simulated DOM enviroment for each testing. afterEach() is a function from Vitest.
 * Vitest will run this cleanup function after our every
 * testing. This cleanup() deletes the simulated DOM. So we can create a new simulated DOM for the
 * next testing. Testing in this case is runnung one it() function in our test file.
